&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I literally love Microsoft Sculpt keyboard and mouse. I have tried other ergo keyboard (e.g. Logitech K860) however size and keys placement in Microsoft fits me more than any other ergo equipment.
Currently I am using my second set of Microsoft Sculpt. I have been using previous Sculpt set for an about 4 years - after couple of years of hard usage some keys need to be pushed hard to get any reaction from pressing so I decided on replacement with shiny new set.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;However this is the first time I changed my operating system from linux to macOS (precisely MacBook Pro M1). Unfortunately, it wasn't so easy like with linux - keyboard and mouse were lagging.
I though it might be some issues with drivers but after searching through the internet I didn't find any confirmation of that theory. Finally I tried to put plugged dongle closer to my keyboard and magically all issues disappeared (seems to distance from dongle to keyboard in macOS matters more than in linux).
How close to keyboard/mouse dongle should be to cooperate nice with macOs ? Below there are pictures before and after arrangement.


Before (lagging hard):
{% include aligner.html images="feature-img/dongle-before.jpeg" column=1 %}


After (works like a charm):
{% include aligner.html images="feature-img/dongle-after.jpeg" column=1 %}



By the way adapter which is used to connect dongle also matters (e.g. previously I used different and in my opinion currently works better)
